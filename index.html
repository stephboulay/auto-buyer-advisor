				<h2>AUTO BUYER ADVISOR</h2>
				<p>If you cringe at the thought of going to a dealership and playing the game of ping pong between the sales person and manager in an attempt to get you “the best deal”, consider using the services of ABA.</p>
				<p>With years of experience in the automotive industry selling and leasing Mercedes Benz, Porche, Audi, Honda and Subaru as well as a broad spectrum of used vehicles, I felt there was an unmet need in assisting and advising car buyers in navigating the buying/leasing and finance processes.  We can assist in any research you may require, guide you through benefits and drawbacks of buying vs. leasing and prepare you for the delivery of your new or used vehicle.</p>
				<p>We help guide you around the pitfalls many buyers fall into when guided through the process by a sales person who is going to “ do their best to get you the best price “.</p>
				<p>If you want to get a great deal on a new or used car, eliminate the stress of negotiating and wondering if you got a good deal, consider using ABA.</p>
				<p>And yes, we go to the delivery with you to be sure the deal is completed to your satisfaction.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>FREE consultation prior to beginning the car buying process is part of our service.  We want to be sure that our service is a good fit for your needs.  </li>
					<li>Have an industry expert guide you through the entire process, including being with you when you take delivery of your new or used vehicle.  With years of experience in sales and leasing Mercedes Benz, Audi, Porche, Subaru, Honda, Mitsubishi and a broad spectrum of every imaginable pre-owned vehicle, I’ll be on your side working only for you every step of the way. </li>
					<li>Minimize surprises during the buying process as well as the finance office where surprisingly, a tremendous amount of profit can be realized for the finance manager and the dealership.</li>
					<li>We are not compensated by the dealer or act as a broker in any way.  Our customers pay a simple low flat fee (See our fee schedule) and our only interest is in assisting our buyer in obtaining a great deal with minimal stress.  </li>
